# Isolated Gateway Deployment

## Terms

**MCP Gateway Instance**: A single deployment of the broker and router components within a given namespace.

## Use Cases

- Allow platform administrators to configure isolated MCP Gateways to segregate data and workloads according to their needs.
- Allow multiple Gateway API `Gateway` resources to be handled by a single MCP Gateway deployment.

## Overview

> Note: The existing MCP controller component is expected to evolve into a full MCP operator capable of both reconciling MCPServerRegistration instances and deploying MCP Gateway instances into targeted namespaces. This design reflects a step towards that future.

The existing behavior of the MCP Gateway Controller, which has remained in place from the proof of concept (PoC), is to:
1. Discover all MCPServerRegistration resources across the cluster
2. Construct a unified MCP configuration from them
3. Create that configuration in a known secret in the `mcp-system` namespace
4. Mount this secret into the broker and router components

The broker and router are unaware of Kubernetes by design. Achieving isolation by deploying multiple MCP Gateway instances in different namespaces and manually constructing the configuration for each deployment is already possible, but it would be cumbersome and would require abandoning the MCP controller.

The changes proposed here focus on the MCP controller and how it manages and constructs the correct configuration while becoming aware of each MCP Gateway instance.

## Proposal

To achieve isolated deployments, the existing cluster-scoped MCP controller must be informed of which MCPServerRegistrations are within scope for a given MCP Gateway instance and construct a restricted configuration based on this information.

### Introduce MCPGatewayExtension CRD

To support this deployment model and inform the controller of the expected state, we will add a new CRD: `MCPGatewayExtension`. This CRD can be created in any namespace where an MCP Gateway instance is deployed (MCP Gateway instances are currently limited to 1 per namespace). In this proposal, this resource will control which Gateways are in scope for a given MCP Gateway instance. In the future this could be expanded to also control the installation of the MCP Gateway instance.

This resource signals to the controller that any MCP configuration built from MCPServerRegistrations targeting HTTPRoutes attached to that gateway should be placed in the well-known secret within the same namespace as the MCPGatewayExtension resource.

The MCPGatewayExtension can target Gateway API `Gateway` resources in any namespace. To ensure cross-namespace targeting is authorized, the requirement of a [ReferenceGrant](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/referencegrant/) in the targeted gateway's namespace will be enforced unless the MCPGatewayExtension resource is in the same namespace as the Gateway (see diagram below).

**Example Resources:**

```yaml
apiVersion: mcp.kuadrant.io/v1alpha1
kind: MCPGatewayExtension
metadata:
  name: team1
  namespace: team1
spec:
  targetRef:
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway
    name: gateway
    namespace: gateway-system
    sectionName: mcp  # Name of the listener on the Gateway to target
status:
  conditions:
    - type: Ready
      status: "True"
      reason: ValidMCPGatewayExtension
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: ReferenceGrant
metadata:
  name: grant-team1
  namespace: gateway-system
spec:
  from:
    - group: mcp.kuadrant.io
      kind: MCPGatewayExtension
      namespace: team1
  to:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: Gateway
```

### MCPGatewayExtension Controller Behavior

The MCP Gateway Controller will reconcile this new resource in a dedicated MCPGatewayExtension controller. This controller will:

1. Verify that if an MCPGatewayExtension targets a Gateway in another namespace, an associated ReferenceGrant exists
2. Update the MCPGatewayExtension status accordingly (without revealing whether the targeted Gateway resource exists)
3. Watch for deletion or changes to ReferenceGrants and trigger reconciliation of affected MCPGatewayExtension resources

### MCPServerRegistration Controller Behavior

When the existing MCPServerRegistration Controller finds an MCPServerRegistration resource, it will:

1. Look up the targeted HTTPRoute and its parent gateways
2. Look for either a ReferenceGrant in that parent's namespace or an MCPGatewayExtension resource in the same namespace
3. If no valid objects are found, update the MCPServerRegistration with a status of `NotReady` and reason `NoValidMCPGatewayExtension`. The configuration for that server will not be added to any MCP Gateway deployment.
4. For each valid configuration found, add the MCP configuration secret to the same namespace as the MCPGatewayExtension resource (either via ReferenceGrant or by being co-located with the Gateway).


### MCPVirtualServer

This resources has a simplistic approach to limiting the tools returned to an agent. It is not considered a security feature. It is purely a tool for limiting the response to a useful set of tools. It allows specifying a set of tools that will be returned if present based on a header passed by the client. The tools may or may not actually exist in the gateway being targeted by an application. In this proposal, we will not modify the MCPVirtualServer behavior. So its configuration will be added to all MCP Gateway instances. In doing this we don't expose any sensitive information to the clients. If there are no tools that match the list.

> Note The above does not preclude modifying VirtualMCP in the future to allow to specify a target gateway or  HTTPRoute.

### Deploying Multiple Broker and Router Instances

In this initial phase, users will use the Helm charts to deploy the broker and router into a namespace. The Helm chart will also configure the MCPGatewayExtension, EnvoyFilter, and any required ReferenceGrants. In the future, this will also be offered by an operator.

**Diagram**

> Note: The MCP Gateway Controller does not need to be in the same namespace as the MCPGatewayExtension. It is shown that way here purely to reduce noise.

- EnvoyFilter brings traffic to the correct MCP Gateway
- MCPGatewayExtension ensures that MCP Gateway receives the correct MCPConfig
- MCPServerRegistration indicates MCP configuration should be generated for this HTTPRoute

### Targeting Multiple Gateways with a Single MCPGatewayExtension

An MCPGatewayExtension resource can target multiple Gateway resources. As long as there is a ReferenceGrant or the MCPGatewayExtension is in the same namespace as the Gateway, this will result in an updated configuration for the MCP Gateway components. This assumes there is an EnvoyFilter for each of these gateways pointing to the same MCP Gateway instance.

## Updating Existing Deployment

Ideally, users can re-run the Helm chart to bring their installation up to date. The required changes are:

1. Create an MCPGatewayExtension resource in the `mcp-system` namespace targeting the `gateway-system` gateway
2. Create a ReferenceGrant in the `gateway-system` namespace allowing the cross-namespace reference

## Installation Process

Use Helm to install (this adds MCPGatewayExtension and ReferenceGrants to the existing resources). Specify:
- The namespace for the Gateway
- The namespace for the MCPGatewayExtension

## Limitations

**There can only be one MCPGatewayExtension resource per namespace:**

The MCPGatewayExtension resource indicates to the controller where it should create the configuration. This configuration is mounted into the router and broker components via a named secret. Having multiple MCPGatewayExtension resources in a single namespace would result in the secret being overwritten, causing inconsistent behavior. This limitation can be addressed once we add an operator.

**Only one MCPGatewayExtension can target a given gateway:**

The MCPGatewayExtension represents configuring a gateway with the capability to act as an MCP Gateway. As each MCPGatewayExtension is intended to represent a single deployment of the MCP Gateway, it doesn't make sense at this stage to allow multiple extensions to target the same gateway. If multiple MCPGatewayExtensions target a single gateway, this will be considered a conflict by the controller. The controller will use the oldest resource as the valid extension and  mark the conflict in the status of any others via the ready condition.
